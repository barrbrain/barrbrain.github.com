title: svn-dump-fast-export 2.0
---
Thanks to the wonder that is git-subtree, I have finally upstreamed the work in git.git to "svn-dump-fast-export":/svn-dump-fast-export/. Say hello to "svn-fe 2.0":https://github.com/barrbrain/svn-dump-fast-export/commits/svn-fe_2.0.
Since my last post, I've also done a bit of a visual refresh and introduced a human presence. I hope you like it.
