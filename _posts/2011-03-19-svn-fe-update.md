After spending the past month or two familiarising myself with the finer details of git rebase, cherry-pick and send-email, I have finished the preliminary work on porting Jonathan Nieder's series to support text-deltas. We have been prioritising the patches from the megalithic development branch. There's still a lot of cleanup to be done but the patches have been rearranged into a sensible order. Bit by bit, we are getting closer to getting quite a large set of changes to sufficient quality for merging into git.
