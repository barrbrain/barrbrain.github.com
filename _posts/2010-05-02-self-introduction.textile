h1. {{ page.title }}

I've created a simple video using a combination of LiVES, gstreamer and Audacity. I found gstreamer to be quite handy for capturing the video as I could display a preview during capture. I used LiVES to trim the clips, edit together and normalise the colours. I had to use Audacity to apply a noise removal filter as I couldn't find one in LiVES. The result is not particularly impressive - just a talking head - but should be of a higher standard than many of the talking heads of YouTube.
