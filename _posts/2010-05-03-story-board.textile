As video can be quite bandwidth intensive, the primary purpose of the video I've created is to let readers of my blog know how I look and sound.

I was surprised just how hard it is to monologue for the camera. Its been quite a few years since I've done any acting. However, I think performing for a live audience provides sufficient pressure to not stop at mistakes but improvise to cover them. Performing alone for the camera resulted in me halting every time I messed up a line, even if it was just the pace.

You may notice when you watch the video that I talk quite fast. This is despite conscious effort to slow my speech to a broadly understandable rate.

The story board linked to this post was created using GIMP 2.6.8 under OS X. I was working under Debian until yesterday when that laptop became a victim of boot failure. I was pleasantly surprised how much you can achieve without using any patent-encumbered codecs.
