Seven years since beginning this enterprise, I have finally completed my undergraduate studies at the Australian National University. A lot has happened in the intervening years and in a way my degree is the least of my achievements in that period. I am proud to have upheld my commitment to study in the midst of working to support myself, then also a wife and now also a child.

I will soon contact the department to advise that no more bets may be placed and that they should distribute the proceeds of the office pool regarding my graduation.

I hope it won't be long until I resume my academic career but in the meantime I strive for excellence in every pursuit. To my friends still studying I offer my encouragement and hope that my graduation renews hope in them that persistence will bring its reward.
