<h1>What is MULTIPLICATION?</h1>

<p> Multiplication is like you add the number before the multiplication symbol
    as many times as the one after! </p>
<p> For example, if you multiply 9 &amp; 3 it will equal 27 because
    9 + 9 + 9 = 27 but if you find that hard you can do
    3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 27. </p>
<p> If you can't do both of these ways why? Just do 4 + 4 + 4 which equal's 12
    &amp; 5 + 5 + 5 which equal's 15 &amp; 12 + 15 which is 10 + 10 = 20 &amp;
    2 + 5 = 7 &amp; 20 + 7 equals 27! </p>
<p> So if  you understand try do your own multiplication question!!!! </p>
